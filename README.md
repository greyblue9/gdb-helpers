## Overview

This adds some new commands and convenience functions to gdb.  It also
changes some defaults to be more sensible.  I've found this useful
while hacking on firefox.

Also, for Emacs users, this arranges to set `EDITOR` to `emacsclient -n`
when gdb is running inside Emacs, so that the `edit` command will contact
Emacs and not wait for the edit to be complete.  (In this case it also
sets another environment variable so the new `ecomm` command will do
the right thing.)

## Installing

The simplest way is to:

```
make hack-gdbinit
```

This will edit your `.gdbinit` to load the helpers.

## New commands:

* `ecomm N`.  Edit the commands for breakpoint N.  This writes the
  commands out to a file and pops up your editor.  When you're done
  the commands are re-applied.

* `hier CLASS`.  Print the class hierarchy of a class, one line per
  base class.

* `preattach FILE`.  This is like `attach`, but it attaches to the
  next instance of the program.  This relies on SystemTap to do its
  magic.

## New functions

* `$_python(STR)`.  Evaluate `STR` as a Python expression.  This is an
  occasionally handy shortcut to use in place of a new `gdb.Function`
  implementation.

* `$_typeof(EXP)`.  Evaluates EXP and then returns a string
  representation of its dynamic type.  This is handy in conjunction
  with `$_regex` (distributed with gdb) in breakpoint conditions --
  you can easily break only when a specific sub-class is seen.

* `$_upvar(NAME, LIMIT)`.  Search up for at most LIMIT frames, looking
  for a variable named NAME (which must be a string).  If such a
  variable is found, return its value.  Otherwise, an error results.

* `$_up([N = 1])`.  Move up N frames and return 1.  This is sometimes
  useful in conjunction with `$_var`.

* `$_var(NAME)`.  Return the value of a variable named NAME in the
  current frame.

## Oddball Features:

* If you put `\E` into your `extended-prompt`, then when running gdb
  in the shell, changes to the current location will be sent to a
  running Emacs using `emacsclient`.  For best results you will also
  want to `(setq server-raise-frame nil)` in Emacs.

  This is useful if you have to run gdb from the shell for some
  reason, and want see the sources, and don't want to use the TUI, and
  gdb-gui fails due to an obscure bug on your machine.  Cough cough.
